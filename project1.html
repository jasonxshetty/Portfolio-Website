                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>FINN is an AI-powered personal assistant developed to enhance the driving experience. Built on a Raspberry Pi 4, FINN uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API for conversational intelligence and integrates Spotify and Tesla APIs to support real-time monitoring, media control, and contextual voice interactions.</p>

                <h3>Back Story</h3>
                <p>The idea for this project came to life one day as I was driving with my mind off in a tangent about something. I had a question, but nobody was in the car to help research. Then it hit me that an AI assistant would be extremely valuable. I imagined an assistant that not only understands commands but also keeps pace with my needs while on the road—whether by managing Spotify playlists, providing real-time vehicle insights, or simply having a contextual conversation.</p>
                <p>Creating FINN became more than a technical challenge; it became a way to reduce distracted driving by allowing voice-activated commands that eliminate the need to interact with multiple apps and screens. Developing FINN has been both exciting and rewarding, blending AI with practical use cases to make driving safer and smarter. The project showcases how a responsive AI assistant can enhance the driving experience, making it both more enjoyable and focused.</p>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>Project FINN began with configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 as the core platform, where I set up a virtual environment to manage API keys securely and tested initial functionality through a command-line interface using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model. This setup allowed for tuning the assistant’s responses and building a reliable conversational base.</p>
                <p>Once the core interaction was stable, I integrated Mycroft AI for offline voice processing, enabling hands-free Spotify control and Tesla diagnostics, helping to reduce driver distraction. The final phase involved connecting FINN to the Tesla API for real-time vehicle data and control, from checking battery levels to adjusting climate settings. The result is a fully voice-activated AI assistant, blending functionality with convenience to enhance the driving experience safely.</p>

                <h3>How it Works</h3>
                <p>FINN operates as a voice-integrated assistant. Using the wake word “Finn” to activate, the assistant listens to user commands and can control Spotify playback and provide real-time Tesla diagnostics like battery levels. Integrated with Mycroft AI for offline voice processing, FINN responds naturally to commands, helping minimize driver distraction and making interactions seamless and safe.</p>

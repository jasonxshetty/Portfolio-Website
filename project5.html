                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>My teammate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenpaul-/" target="_blank">Allen Paul</a>, and I participated in HackUTD 2024 Ripple Effect, which took place on Nov 16 to Nov 17. We decided to answer the Frontier prompt which had to with providing product recommendations to customers based on their purchase history. To effectively answer this, we decided to train an AI model and design a simple and user friendly UI to provide such recommendations.</p>
                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>We initially brianstormed an effective solution. Because this project was intended for customers, we decided to create a simple but effective UI. We decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, just because that is what I was most comfortable with. For the backend we used Node.js. Node.js was optimal for its speed, scalability, and ability to handle real time data-driven applications. We used TensorFlow for flexibility and support for deep learning. We were able to load the customer data and product catalog, both provided by Frontier, into the model. The product recommendations would be returned to the frontend. The user would be able to see the top 5 products recommended, each with a tailored explanation as to why that product is recommended for the respective customer.</p>
                <h3>How it Works</h3>
                <p>Our application (prodio) allowed the user to enter a customer's name. This customer was one of the many provided to us by Frontier. Once the user entered a customer name, they would be able to see the top 5 product recommendations.</p>
